## 🧠 What is Zenith?

**Zenith** is a minimalist habit tracker designed to reduce noise, not add more of it.

Most habit apps rely on streak pressure, excessive rewards, and notifications.
Zenith takes the opposite approach — **calm, intentional habit building**
with a focus on dopamine management and long-term consistency.
